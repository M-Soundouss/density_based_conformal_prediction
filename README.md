# Density-based Conformal Prediction

Code for article : Deep conformal prediction for robust models : https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50146-4_39

Environment : Python 3.6 with Keras, Tensorflow, ands libraries numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib.

Note : The representations are not deterministic, so it may not have the same results as in the paper,
but the idea and the tendencies remain the same.
